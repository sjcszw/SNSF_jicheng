notationwise is hard to follow, 

part of the mathematical derivation of the results becomes a bit dense; some examples along the way could have been helpful 

More information regarding the comparison with other methods are welcome as well (e.g.,
comments on computation burden).

highlight the usefulness of the methods further by comparing the developed technique against two-step approaches.

Under the observability and excitation assumptions made in this paper,
methods such as subspace identification can be used to generate state
estimates x_d, in a user-selected basis, from the recorded data
(y_d,u_d). The development in [18] can then be used for input
reconstruction. It would be interesting to compare the two approaches
to highlight the practical benefits of the direct approach over the
indirect approach.

(1) The contribution of the work related to other results in the literature is not clear. convergence properties compared to [1 6 9]

to the conventional two step design approach: advantage, complexity of (16) is large

(2) assumption for (1)

(3) N_mea delay

(4) suffient proof of Th 1
To clarify the point it may help that the
authors explicitly state the assumed rank for H and Hu, and how the persistency of excitation condition
in Assumption 1 impacts those ranks


Minor comments and typos


4.
(1) confusing presentation principaly concerning part II and the reference to citation [11],

(2) It could be interesting to add a reference or a comparison with Unknown
Input Observer and PI observer. 

(3) How is it possible to handle controlled input and disturbances? What
about fault detection capability of the procedure?
