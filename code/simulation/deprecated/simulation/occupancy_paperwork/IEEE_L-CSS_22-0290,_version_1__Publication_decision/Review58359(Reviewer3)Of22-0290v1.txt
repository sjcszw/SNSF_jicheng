The paper is well written and structured, but notationwise is hard to
follow, e.g., the use of the bold font and super/subscripts  is very
puzzling some times. Also, part of the mathematical derivation of the
results becomes a bit dense; some examples along the way could have
been helpful to illustrate the main points of the manuscript.
Nevertheless, I am aware that this is almost an impossible task due to
the tight page limit of the journal. Despite these issues, the results
of the paper are relevant and it is very welcome that besides an
academic simulation a real experiment is presented. More information
regarding the comparison with other methods are welcome as well (e.g.,
comments on computation burden).
