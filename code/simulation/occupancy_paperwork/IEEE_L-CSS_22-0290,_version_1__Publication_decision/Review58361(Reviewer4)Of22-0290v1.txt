The paper improves upon the work presented in [18] so that offline
state measurements are no longer required for input reconstruction. 

The development is interesting, but the authors could highlight the
usefulness of the methods further by comparing the developed technique
against two-step approaches.

Under the observability and excitation assumptions made in this paper,
methods such as subspace identification can be used to generate state
estimates x_d, in a user-selected basis, from the recorded data
(y_d,u_d). The development in [18] can then be used for input
reconstruction. It would be interesting to compare the two approaches
to highlight the practical benefits of the direct approach over the
indirect approach.
